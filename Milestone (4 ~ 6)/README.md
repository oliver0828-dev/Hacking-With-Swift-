## From HWS
The player needs to select which multiplication tables they want to practice. This could be pressing buttons, or it could be an “Up to…” stepper, going from 2 to 12.
The player should be able to select how many questions they want to be asked: 5, 10, or 20.
You should randomly generate as many questions as they asked for, within the difficulty range they asked for.
