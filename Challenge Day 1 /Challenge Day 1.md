## Overview 
This app is built for the Milestone Project for 100 Days of SwiftUI. For the User Interface, I wanted to add the Vision Pro glass texture to the app. Therefore, I chose a white background with lower opacity. This type of background is used for all the buttons and backgrounds. Feature-wise, just like the game, the user will get three choices: Rock, Paper, and Scissors. In addition, the instruction wanted ten rounds, so I decided to send the reset alert with a score once the ten rounds were reached. For the first time, I added the Haptic Feedback to make the game fun.
