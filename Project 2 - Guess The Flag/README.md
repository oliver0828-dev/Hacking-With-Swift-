## Explanation
In this second SwiftUI project we’re going to be building a guessing game that helps users learn some of the many flags of the world.

This project is still going to be nice and easy, but gives me chance to introduce you to whole range of new SwiftUI functionality: stacks, buttons, images, alerts, asset catalogs, and more.

Our first app used a completely standard iOS look and feel, but here we’re going to make something more customized so you can see how easy it is with SwiftUI.

## Add On
Since the course didn’t address the score being updated, I decided to add a variable. When the users get the questions right, the value and alert will automatically increase.
