## What I learned: 
The course mainly covered the story regarding the Codable, JSON decoder, columns, and LazyVGrid. The idea regarding the columns and LazyVGrid was easy to assimilate. However, the data file using Codable to translate all the data from the JSON file was quite challenging, but I understood how to decode the JSON.
