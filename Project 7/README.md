# Overview:
In this course, I learned how I can use Codable, Identifiable, and Class with Observable to control the user's data. 
Of course, this might be the hardest challenge I have ever done, as I learn about @AppStorage and UserDefaults, I started to grasp the idea of data flow in Swift. 
JSONDecoder() was the hardest to grasp at once. 

## Challenge: 
For my challenge, I initially relied on the currency changed that we did in WeSplit project, and for the colors, as the money changed I gave different colors. Lastly for the section, I used If Statement to deteremine if the item.type is Personal or Buisness. And for each section, the values in list will have their own SF Symbols.
