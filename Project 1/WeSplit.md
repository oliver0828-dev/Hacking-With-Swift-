# Project 1 - WeSplit 

## Things that I learned: 
Form, Section, NavigationView, @State property wrapper, TextField, Picker, ForEach 

## Challenge: 
1. Add a header to the third section, saying “Amount per person”.
2. Add another section showing the total amount for the check – i.e., the original amount plus tip value, without dividing by the number of people.
3. Change the “Number of people” picker to be a text field, making sure to use the correct keyboard type.
